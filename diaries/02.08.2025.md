## Options

**Options** are never easy. Choosing what you love to do, or who you love. Choosing the easy but quick, or hard and better path. 

**Options**. No one really likes options, but I am only faced with them daily. Taking the longer path is better, usually. Sometimes just getting it over with feels nicer to yourself.

Over the past few months, I have only been faced with **options** and not chosen the right ones throughout.

Remember, take time choosing as they face your future.
