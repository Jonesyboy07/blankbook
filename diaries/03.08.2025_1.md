# Loss.

What is loss?

"the harm or privation resulting from losing or being separated from someone or something."

Loss is painful, but it is human. One can endure loss, or crumble if support was there. Kinda like a building.

If a building has enough supports, it can stay up. One wrong brick, or a gap in the connections and it can crumble down.

Or, an action can cause a reaction. Sometimes, reactions. Losing people isnt easy. 

Small, or even big, actions can cause loss. Accidentally catch a brick in Jenga, and it allllll falls down.

Be careful what you do, and who you lean on. Maybe loss is to teach.
