# **Time**

Since my last message, ive had **time** to think about me. What went wrong, and how i can try to change.

I lost probably the person i was closest to. That really hurt. I dont cry much, but this person brought waves.

I recently spoke about building onto a person, like structures of a building. Turns out i only built onto one person, and now im just rubble.

Its hard to pick up the pieces of yourself without the connections you once had. The friends, The family.

Loss is hard, but it only gets harder over **time**.

But sometimes, **time** helps you to heal and it should get better.

TLDR:

Dont build supports on one island, it speeds up the **time** it has left.
