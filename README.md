# What is this?

This is the code (behind the scenes) for my website, https://eascrapbook.org.

# Why is it public?

Its simple, why hide the truth? Id rather people see how it works and take inspiration.

# How does the site work?

Well.. Python Flask! It gets a little messier.

# How easy is it to update?

I have a wonderful Github Auto Pull + Reset script setup, which is hidden. What that does is checks for a git Change ( Commits ) and then pulls + resets it. I dont use Debug mode, meaning no auto restart and **i** chose the files it resets for.
